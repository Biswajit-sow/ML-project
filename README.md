**Nexus: Your AI-Powered Career Suite**

Nexus is a comprehensive, AI-driven application designed to assist users with career development. It combines two powerful tools into a single, user-friendly interface: the AI Career Advisor and the Smart Academic Mentor. This suite is built using Python, LangChain, and Gradio, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

üöÄ Features
1. AI Career Advisor

The AI Career Advisor offers an in-depth analysis of your resume against a specific job description. This tool is invaluable for anyone looking to tailor their application for a particular role.

Resume and Job Description Analysis: Upload your resume (in PDF or DOCX format) and paste the job description to receive a detailed analysis.

Skill Gap Visualization: A dynamic radar chart is generated to visually represent the gaps between your skills and the job requirements.

In-depth Reporting: The analysis includes a match score, a summary of your strengths and weaknesses, and a list of keywords from the job description that are present or missing in your resume.

Actionable Feedback: Receive concrete suggestions for improvement and a list of potential interview questions based on the analysis.

2. Smart Academic Mentor

The Smart Academic Mentor is your personal guide for learning and skill development. Whether you're starting with the suggestions from the Career Advisor or have your own learning goals, the mentor is here to help.

Personalized Learning Roadmaps: Get a structured, step-by-step learning plan for any topic you want to master.

Interactive Chat Interface: Engage in a conversation with the mentor to refine your learning goals and get answers to your questions.

Visual Learning Timelines: For a clearer understanding of your learning path, you can request a visual roadmap that outlines each stage of your development, including topics, duration, and milestones.

Voice-to-Text Functionality: Interact with the mentor using your voice for a hands-free experience.

Interactive Quizzes: Test your knowledge on any subject by asking the mentor to start a quiz.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Backend: Python, LangChain, Groq API

Frontend: Gradio

Document Loading: PyMuPDF, Docx2txt

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, NumPy

Speech Recognition: SpeechRecognition

üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the Nexus application up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus.git
cd nexus

2. Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies.

Generated bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.

Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
4. Set Up Environment Variables

You will need to configure your API keys in an environment file.

Create a new file named .env in the root directory of the project.

Add the following lines to the .env file, replacing the placeholder text with your actual API keys:

Generated env
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langchain_api_key"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Env
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

GROQ_API_KEY: This is essential for the application's Large Language Model (LLM) to function. You can obtain a key from the Groq website.

LANGCHAIN_API_KEY: This is required for tracing and monitoring the application's performance with LangSmith. You can get a key from the LangChain website.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once you have completed the setup, you can launch the application with the following command:

Generated bash
python app.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This will start the Gradio server, and you will see a local URL in your terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860). Open this URL in your web browser to start using Nexus.
